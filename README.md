# BookingApp
Application for bookings

I built an application to perform bookings for a restaurant.Then, I built a simple website to interact with the backend application. I used Intellij IDE to develop the application. Also, I used Postman to test the application. Please read documentation.docx in ./documentation and database/ for more information.

I add some screenshots of the website below.
